# Logistic Regression

Logistic regression is a fundamental classification algorithm in machine learning. It builds upon linear regression but is used for predicting binary outcomes. Understanding logistic regression is crucial as it forms the basis for more complex models, especially in classification tasks.

## What You'll Learn

This repository contains progressive notebooks that gradually deepen your understanding of logistic regression:

### 1. `foundations.ipynb`
**Building Logistic Regression from Scratch**
- Implement logistic regression without using libraries
- Understand the mathematical foundation (sigmoid activation and log-loss)
- Work with simple synthetic data
- Learn how to optimize using gradient descent
- Build intuition for how the decision boundary is learned

## Learning Resources

The concepts in these notebooks are based on the following educational resources:

- [Stanford CS229 Lecture Notes](https://cs229.stanford.edu/main_notes.pdf)
- [Locally Weighted & Logistic Regression - Andrew Ng](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=het9HFqo1TQ)
